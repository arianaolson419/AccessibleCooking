<h1>About Sightless Chef</h1>
<p>
We recognize that people who are visually impaired often find conventional cooking resources inaccessible. As such, Sightless Chef compiles accessible recipes written by amateur and professional chefs with visual impairments. We are the most comprehensive source of recipes and cooking tips for the blind, whether you are new to cooking with visual impairments or an experienced chef.

<h1>Why Sightless Chef?</h1>
<p>
  Cooking resources are dispersed over the internet and in physical cookbooks. It can be 
  difficult to obtain cooking resources geared for people who have vision impairments; 
  most recipes and other instructions are written for people who can rely on visual clues. 
  Most cooking implements are also made to rely on visual indication. Additionally, many 
  recipe websites are difficult or impossible to navigate with a screen reader. Visually 
  impaired cooks need to hunt down applicable recipes, tips, videos, and other resources, 
  and then compile their own knowledge to compensate for the lack of truly accessible 
  recipes and resources. Many cooks also have to improvise ways to make use of common 
  sight-based cues. This can create a barrier to entry for someone who doesn’t know where 
  to start and a significant delay for the more experienced chef. 
</p>
<p>
  With Sightless Chef, we hope that no matter the level of experience, a visually impaired cook 
  can come to this website and quickly find a certain technique or recipe. These resources 
  will be screen reader friendly and may come with audio or visual supplements geared 
  towards audiences who are visually impaired. Users can upload their own recipes, tips, 
  or techniques, and comment on others'. Our goal is to concentrate resources in one place 
  and provide a living community that will allow people who are visually impaired to help 
  one another in the kitchen.
